# Linkr

<img src="./public/linkr.gif"/>

This is a social media created to make it easier to share interesting links, sites and videos found all over the internet. Come take a look!

To achieve this goal, it was developed as a single page application using [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a fork of this [project](https://github.com/Nello-Moreira/Projeto11_Linkr) I developed in collaboration with [Gabriel](https://github.com/Nello-Moreira) and [Gian](https://github.com/giancarvalho). We made it to "[bootcamp de desenvolvimento web full stack - Responde a√≠/Driven](https://driven.com.br/)" (full-stack web development) and now I'm working on developing new features to practice my skills with React.

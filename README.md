# Projeto11_Linkr
This is a social media created to make it easier to share interesting links, sites and videos found all over the internet. Come take a look!

To achieve this goal, it was developed as a single page application using [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

This is the 11th project made to 
"[bootcamp de desenvolvimento web full stack - Responde a√≠/Driven](https://driven.com.br/)" 
(full-stack web development) and was made in collaboration with [Gabriel](https://github.com/Nello-Moreira), [Gian](https://github.com/giancarvalho) and [Yasmim](https://github.com/yasmimc).
